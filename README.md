Cross-sectional data on agency characteristics and police homicides.

This repository contains two spreadsheets, one for police departments and one for sheriff's offices. All variables are identical. Police homicides are aggregates for 2013-2019. Officers and population served are from 2012 (LEAIC and LEOKA), census population and murders are from 2018 (ACS and OKLE). 

SO census data is for the county as a whole, not the population served by the agency.
