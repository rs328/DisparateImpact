Cross-sectional data on agency characteristics and police homicides.

This repository contains two spreadsheets, one for police departments and one for sheriff's offices. All variables are identical. Police homicides are aggregates for 2013-2019. Officers and population served are from 2012 (LEAIC and LEOKA), census population is from 2018 (ACS), crimes are aggregates for 2013-19 (OKLE), and gun death rates are based on county data from 1999-2019 (CDC) with suppressed counties assigned data from the balance of the state. 

All states have gun death data by race and ethnicity for the three largest demographic groups excpet Vermont, which has less than 10 Hispanic gun deaths deaths over the 20 year period so data for this group is supressed.
